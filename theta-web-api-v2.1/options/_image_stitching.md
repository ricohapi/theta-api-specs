| dynamicSemiAuto | Performs semi-dynamic stitching<br>Saves dynamic distortion correction parameters for the first image and then uses them for the 2nd and subsequent images(RICOH THETA X and later) |
| dynamicSave | Performs dynamic stitching and then saves distortion correction parameters |
| dynamicLoad | Performs stitching using the saved distortion correction parameters |
| none | Does not perform stitching |
