# \_filter

### Overview

Image processing filter.

Configured the filter will be applied while in still image shooting mode. However, it is disabled during continuous shooting.

When \_filter is enabled, it takes priority over the exposure program ([exposureProgram](exposure_program.md)). Also, when \_filter is enabled, the exposure program is set to the Normal program.

The current setting can be acquired by [camera.getOptions](../commands/camera.get_options.md), and it can be changed by [camera.setOptions](../commands/camera.set_options.md).
